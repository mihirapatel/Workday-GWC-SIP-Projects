    <p>The Summer Immersion Program is a seven-week program hosted at various tech companies. 20 girls are selected to participate at each program, where they learn about the world of computer science through the Girls Who Code curriculum, in addition to various guest speakers, field trips to tech companies, and mentorship from female engineers at the host company. In the first five weeks, the girls learn multiple programming languages and complete labs to apply the skills they learn. They learn Python, Object Oriented Programming with Python, robotics using C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The last two weeks are dedicated to the girls creating their final projects. These can be done individually or in groups and in any language the girls choose.</p>
